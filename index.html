      Life is a beautiful journey that is meant to be embraced to the fullest every day. However, 
      that doesn't mean you always wake up ready to seize the day, and sometimes need a reminder that life is a great gift.
      Whether a funny quote from a famous celebrity or an encouraging message about giving it your best from a successful business person, 
      we can all use a little motivation and inspiration these days via a life quote.
